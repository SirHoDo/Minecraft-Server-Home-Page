## About The Project

[![Project Screenshot](https://iungo.info/images/banner-example.png)](https://iungo.info)

Welcome to the Server Card project, where we aim to simplify the process of sharing your Minecraft server details with your community. This project is designed to create "Server Cards" that provide a quick overview of your Minecraft server, including its icon, name, IP address, MOTD (Message of the Day), and the number of online players.

**Why I Created This Project:**

Minecraft servers come in all shapes and sizes, and server owners often want to make it as easy as possible for players to join. That's where Server Cards come in. I created this project to offer a user-friendly solution for server owners to share their server's key information with their community in a style reminiscent of the official Minecraft Server List.

**Key Features:**
- Display your server's icon, name, IP address, MOTD, and online players.
- User-friendly interface for easy access and sharing.
- Click on the card to copy the IP address to your clipboard for quick server access.

I believe this project can streamline the process of sharing server information and enhance your community experience. You can integrate the Server Card into your own server's landing page to make it more accessible to players.
